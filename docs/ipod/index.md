## The revolutionary iPod is coming

Before we dive into the narrative of what is now considered a classic example of Apple's massive success and Steve Jobs' visionary acumen, let's stop with something else. We'll look at the events that preceded it and explain how this breakthrough came about. And from which we learn that Apple's success in the music field and in the design of the iPod was bought by a hard lesson in what it had until then considered the core of its business: computers. We'll talk about the early days of the iMac line of computers. 

When Steve Jobs returned to Apple as interim CEO in 1997, Apple had a wide range of products to sell. Too broad, Jobs reasoned - customers had trouble navigating it. The product line varied in memory combinations, case size and design, and processor clock speeds. Only fans were eager to distinguish the Power Macintosh family by numbers. Jobs himself later said that even he had to spend three weeks explaining to people in the product division what was under what number and who the product was for. He may have been exaggerating in a way, but he was right about one fundamental point: it was hard for customers to choose a computer from Apple's lineup. As late as 1997, Jobs stopped production of two-thirds of the models, much to the chagrin of fans, including a personal digital assistant called the Newton.  

We'll stop with Newton for a moment. This "palm computer" came on the scene in 1993 and is said to have been only hated and cancelled by Jobs because it was pushed by Apple's then-hated CEO John Sculley. In reality, it was more about Jobs' intellectual disagreement with the product, as it represented everything Jobs hated in a user-centric way, especially the stylus control and the still-unrefined at the time handwriting recognition. Although the Newton's handwriting recognition was revolutionary for its time, it consistently fell short of the quality Jobs would have expected from the product, could not be relied upon, and often had to be corrected or a different variant of the recognized word had to be selected. It was still far from perfect. Jobs had long taken the position that rather than market a product that was imperfect in one of the key parameters, it was better not to offer it. The axe flashed over the Newton's head in early 1997 when Jobs cut its division, but by the end of the year he realized that although the product was promising, Apple did not currently have the power to push it to a state where the company could be satisfied with it. And Apple needed to focus on its core revenue segments, to return Apple to profit. For fiscal year 1997, Apple lost more than $1 billion, and Jobs later admitted that the company was three months away from bankruptcy. It couldn't afford sentimental clinging to a product, however groundbreaking and well-received by fans, when it wasn't making money and needed major restructuring. 

And it was this stubbornness and pragmatism that was probably behind the decision to write off Newton and put the whole Newton OS on ice. Seven years later, when Jobs thinks about the personal device Apple should produce, he will remember Newton and use the experience as a deterrent. He will decisively dismiss the capacitive display, the stylus, and the constantly underdeveloped handwriting recognition. But that's a long way off. 

Jobs has decided that Apple products must be divisible into a simple matrix and will be marketed and sold as such. Until then, Apple's method of responding to merchant requests had reigned: merchants reported that the market wanted something, and engineers modified an existing model to create a new model line. This created fragmentation, a lack of clarity that ultimately did not benefit sales, because a few dealers had a lineup that fit their request, but others did not pay attention to it. Jobs's decision was primarily to make the products clearer, but it also had another desired effect: better handling of inventory, the ability to respond more quickly to requests because the options for putting together new computers were significantly more limited. 

Jobs' product matrix provided for two main categories of computers, Customer and Professional, and there were to be two variants, Desktop and Portable. That's a total of four products. For Apple to have introduced fifteen different computers in 1997, and to have produced many more from the previous year's model lines, it is clear that this was a major cut. The professional line of computers would henceforth be based on the Power Macintosh G3, and in portable computers Apple would concentrate on the PowerBook G3, but in end-user computers Apple had nothing to offer. Yet it was in the end-user segment that demand was growing and where Jobs' vision of a "digital hub" could be more easily realized

It was necessary to start looking, to start designing. In 1997, Apple was selling no computer for less than $2000, and that was too much for the end-user segment. It needed to be pushed lower, ideally to the $1,000 mark. Eventually, the decision to start with the cheapest computers at $1,200 fell through. 

Jobs envisioned an all-in-one computer. He hated connecting the various elements of a computer with wires, and in the past Apple had scored many times with designs where the display was built into the body of the computer itself. So the design team went back to 1984, when the original Macintosh was created, a computer that had a monitor combined with the computer itself.
